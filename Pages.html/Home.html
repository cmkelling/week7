    <h3>The Why</h3> <br>
    <p>Getting things done around the house can be hard, so creating a rewards system helps motivate you to clean and organize!</p> <br> <br> <br>
    <h3>The How</h3> <br>
    <p>On the next two pages are chores that need to be done, either daily, weekly, or monthly as well as a tiered table of rewards that can be gotten for completing chore(s) based on the amount of time/ effort spent on them. <br> A form is available to submit completed chores as well as links leading to each pages for easy navigation.</p> <br>
